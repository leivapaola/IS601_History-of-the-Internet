                <span class="lead">The innovation of the computer coupled with the internet</span> has changed the way
                the modern world will survive. This evolution is larger than what trains and automobiles have done for
                our economy. TVs and radios took 20 years before they became mainstream. It only took the personal
                computer (pc) 4 years to gain 50 million users. This created huge demand for cheaper and faster
                computers. With online users growing faster than the demand could keep up with, a whole new maker was
                fueled. Companies such as eBay and Amazon had stock values in the billions due to this new world of
                online shoppers.

            <p>This also created a new market for the stock market. Day traders sitting home were becoming wealthier
                faster than ever. By the 1990â€™s there was a computer and internet connection in most homes. This new era
                saw huge growth in startup companies where teenagers were becoming millionaires overnight. With the
                stock market at an all-time high the chairman of the federal reserve (Alan Greenspan) tried to cool
                things down by raising interest rates in the 2000s.

            <p>This dotcom bubble finally burst in 2001 and lost 3 1/2 trillion dollars in paper worth in 1 year.
                Millions of dot com companies vanished in the next couple years which allowed for more stable companies
                such as eBay and Amazon to see continued growth. Although this rapid growth created a new wealth, and
                the crash ruined many lives analysts believe the outcome was worth it. A new infrastructure in
                e-commerce was built in 5 years as opposed to a normal 15-year growth
